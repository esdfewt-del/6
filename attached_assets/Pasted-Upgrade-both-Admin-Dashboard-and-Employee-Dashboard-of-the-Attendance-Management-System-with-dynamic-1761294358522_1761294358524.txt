Upgrade both Admin Dashboard and Employee Dashboard of the Attendance Management System with dynamic database integration, data visualization, and improved UI/UX functionality.Ensure smooth API integration, proper error handling, and responsive frontend

🧑‍💼 ADMIN DASHBOARD UPDATES

1. inside  Attendance (Attendance Management)

a. Export Attendance

Add Start Date and End Date filters.

When selected, the system should fetch attendance data between those dates dynamically from the database.

Enable Export to Excel functionality using libraries like xlsx or SheetJS.

The exported file should contain proper column headers: Employee Name, ID, Date, Check-in, Check-out, Status, etc.

Ensure all previous and current records are accessible.

b. Attendance Records

Implement date filter functionality (on the right side).

When a specific date is selected, show attendance data for that date for all employees.

Fix the issue where even though data exists in the database, it is not displaying for certain dates.

Ensure database queries properly return results for the selected date range.

c. Display Employee Names

Currently showing just "Employee" — replace it with actual Employee Name fetched from the database.

Ensure names dynamically load and correspond correctly to employee IDs.

inside Leave Management in Leave Requests remove Actions column  

2. inside Reports (Reports & Analytics)

a. Present Today Section

Fix issue where “Present Today” is not loading.

Load data dynamically from the database based on current date.

Use efficient database queries and real-time updates if possible.


b. Attendance Report (Graphs)

Display two graphs for attendance data:

Absents / Leaves Graph – visualizing total absences and leaves across all employees.

Overall Employee Attendance Graph – showing overall attendance trends (present vs absent).

Include Start Date and End Date filters for both graphs.

Data must render dynamically and update automatically when dates are changed.

Represent data day-wise, showing trends across the selected range.

Use chart libraries like Chart.js, ECharts, or Recharts.

Make the graphs visually appealing with legends, tooltips, and responsive design.



c. Leave Report

Under Leave Report (Approved):

Show all approved leaves for all employees.

Include fields like Employee Name, Leave Type, Duration, and Dates.


👨‍💻 EMPLOYEE DASHBOARD UPDATES

1. UI Simplification

Remove the “Settings” section completely.

Keep only the Notifications area, and also remove the "Settings" label above notifications.


2. Attendance Section

a. Attendance History (Graphs)

Employee should be able to view their personal attendance records in graph format.

Implement two types of graphs:

Daily Attendance Graph

When a different month is selected, dates and attendance data should change dynamically.

Include tooltips for each day (Present, Absent, Leave).

Data fetched dynamically from database.

Monthly Summary Graph

Displays total number of Presents, Absents, and Leaves for the selected month.

Use a different chart type (e.g., Pie Chart or Bar Graph).

Make it visually appealing with color-coded statuses.

Dynamically render data for each selected month.

Ensure graphs are responsive, modern, and visually clean.

Provide filters for month/year selection.



🧠 Extra Enhancements (Recommended)

Use real-time updates 

Make sure all queries and endpoints are optimized for performance.
